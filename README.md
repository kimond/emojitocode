Emoji To Code
=============

Emojitocode is a weechat script that converts alias such `:)` to their unicode version.

### Why another weechat emoji script?
It is an addition to [emoji.lua](https://weechat.org/scripts/source/emoji.lua.html/). It is a great script and works very well
but I need to enter the complete emoji short code like that `:smile:` each time.
I wanted to be able to enter ASCII emojis like `:)` and convert them to their Unicode version once we send the message.
After that, Slack would be able to parse my converted emojis to their short code and shows them correctly.

Thanks!
